      Hello! My name is Daniel Melchor. I am from Playa del Carmen, Mexico.
      I really like going to the beach, swimming, and listening to music.
      I'm currently studying Web Design and Development, and I’m looking
      forward to learning more about this topic and being able to create
      my own website.
